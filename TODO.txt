This is an informal changelog/todo for the development version of WP-dTree.

There's three things you can do to help out: 
	1. run this version on your blog and report any issues.
	2. check something off the TODO-list. :)
	3. buy me a (used) book. 

Thank you!

TODO:
Find out how to use the new variable hooks, update the hooks used.
Make the caching behaviour more obvious OR more transparent. 
 	- prominent button for "refresh cache?
	- inline documentation? 
	- or find every possibly related WP hook to run cache updates on. 

Filter category tree content, so multi-cat posts are included only once. (see wp-dtree_cat-functions.php -> $allowDupes)
Display information message on first run. (tell user to activate widgets, and where the settings are)
