This is an informal changelog/todo for the development version of WP-dTree.

There's two things you can do to help out: 
	1. run this version on your blog and report any issues.
	2. check something off the TODO-list. :)

Thank you!

TODO:
Clean up the settings page "backend" (eg. the huge _POST-check)
Make the caching behaviour more obvious OR more transparent. 
 	- prominent button for "refresh cache?
	- inline documentation? 
	- or find every possibly related WP hook to run cache updates on. 

Filter category tree content, so multi-cat posts are included only once. (see wp-dtree_cat-functions.php -> $allowDupes)
Display information message on first run. (tell user to activate widgets, and where the settings are)


KNOWN ISSUES:
Settings are not initialized correctly. (you must visit the settings page after upgrading!)
Open To Selection breaks archive tree. Again.
RSS icons are not displayed in IE if count is on.
